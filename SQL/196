Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.
#-----
In MySQL it is using slef join, you can combine delete and join like this
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
ON p1.Email = p2.Email
WHERE p1.Id > p2.Id;
####################--------------------############
But PostgreSQL does not support it
You have to to use keyword 'USING' with DELETE or UPDATE operation
DELETE FROM Person p1
USING Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email
  AND p1.Id > p2.Id;

#######------------------------###################-----------

In PostgreSQL, the keyword USING inside a DELETE (and also UPDATE) is a way to perform a self-join or join with another table during the delete operation.
DELETE FROM target_table [AS alias]
USING other_table [AS alias]
WHERE condition;

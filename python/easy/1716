You're on the right track with the logic for Leetcode 1716: **Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank**, 
Each Monday, a person deposits money starting from \$1 and increases the amount by \$1 each day until Sunday. Every new week, the Monday deposit increases by \$1 compared to the previous week.

So:
- Week 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 â†’ total = 28
- Week 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 â†’ total = 35
- Week 3: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 â†’ total = 42
- And so on...

### ðŸ§® Correct Formula
Let:
- \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{7} \right\rfloor \) â†’ full weeks
- \( e = n \mod 7 \) â†’ extra days

Then:
- Total from full weeks: \( \sum_{i=0}^{x-1} (28 + i \cdot 7) = 7x(x+1)/2 \)
- Total from extra days: \( \sum_{i=0}^{e-1} (x + i) = ex + \frac{e(e-1)}{2} \)

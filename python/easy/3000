Diagonal math.sqrt[a**2 + b**2)

Python also allows unpacking inside the loop:
for w, h in list1:
    print(w, h)

utput:

10 3
5 9
8 3


Here, instead of giving you the list [10,3] as x, Python directly unpacks it into w and h.
So both are correct:

for x in list1: → x is [w, h]

for w, h in list1: → w is x[0], h is x[1]
